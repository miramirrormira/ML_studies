Neural Network is proven to be able to approximate any continuous function, which makes it suitable to express various relationships.


If a model is essentially a linear model, then it's often good to add nonlinarity to the model. It will make the model more expressive and describe more complex relationships.

High dimension reduction:
- Principle Component
- Autoencoder
